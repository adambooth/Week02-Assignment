Week02-Assignment

Achieved Requirements :
I used javascript to make the functionality of the photo gallery work properly
I added some ARIA elements and alt tags
I added keybindings
I implemented media queries

Unachieved Goals:

srcset i was unable to implement this

Requested Feedback :

i would like some feedback on the stretch requirement `Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.`

External Help :
Chatgpt(ELI5) only used to talk me through mistakes and guide me to fixing them without giving me answers. i used this to help fix responsivness as i had a problem when the screen size went under 600px in width the body was shrinking moving everything out of line. It helped me identify the problem and solve it on my own using correct positioning,min/max width and display format.

What i found difficult:
i struggled with some of the javascript mainly getting the buttons to know which current image was showing. I also had a css problem as talked about above.

I Learnt :
I advanced my javascript and html skills.
